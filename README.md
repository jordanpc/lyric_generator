Final Project - Machine Learning Lyric Generator

### About us
Jordan, Ray, Eric, and Francis 

We love lyrics, and we want to make a ML tool that generate fire lyrics.



Final Project - Machine Learning

1. Find a Problem worth Solving, Analyzing, or Visualizing

2. Use ML in the context of technologies learned

3. You must use:
	• Sci-Kit Learn and/or another machine learning library
	
4. You must use at least two of the below
	• Python Pandas
	• Python Matplotlib
	• Python Tweepy
	• Python Flask
	• HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
	• JavaScript Plotly
	• Javascript D3.js
	• JavaScript Leaflet
	• MySQL Database
	• MongoDB Database
	• Google Cloud SQL
	• Amazon AWS
	• Tableau

Prepare a 15 minute “data deep dive” or “infrastructure walkthrough” that shows machine learning the context of what we’ve already learned.
