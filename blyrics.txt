"playin everything so easy 
its like you seem so sure 
still your ways you dont see
 im not sure if theyre for me 
then things come right along our way though we didnt truly ask 
it seems as if theyre gonna linger
with every delight they bring 
just like what you have truly seemed 
 im trying to think of what youreally want to say 
even through my darkest day 
you might want to leave me 
feeling strange about you
like youre gonna let me know 
when words then slipped out of you 
when words dont come so easy to say
you just leave me feeling come what may
though i want things coming from your way 
i say to you you bore me all the time
when you seem to hold back all in you 
all that you want to let me know 
why dont you have the courage 
speak up and ill listen 
if you truly want me to know then tell me 
is there something wrong with you
and you seem fastened there 
it sounds as if therell be a melody
if things in you are let out
and then i will feel alright 
when you sleep do you feel the same 
exactly as i do 
i really want to hear things from you 
though ive felt something new
eversince you acted that way if i go 
would you still mind telling me if i stay 
you seem to let the days go by 
if you truly want to let me know 
then tell me "
"if you search
for tenderness
it isnt hard to find
you can have the love
you need to live
but if you look
for truthfulness
you might just
as well be blind
it always seems to be
so hard to give honesty
is such a lonely word
everyone is so untrue honesty
is hardly ever heard and mostly
what i need from you
i can always
find someone to say
they sympathize
if i wear my heart
out on my sleeve
but i dont want
some pretty face to tell me
pretty lies all i want
is someone to believe
i can find a lover
i can find a friend
i can have security
until the bitter end
anyone can comfort me
with promises again
i know i know
when im deep
inside of me dont be
too concerned
i wont ask for nothin
while im gone
but when i want sincerity
tell me where else can i turn
when
youre the one
that i depend upon

with eyes lead to a pot of gold
who there to save the hero
when she left all alone 
and she crying out for help
who there to save the hero

after she saves the world 
after she saves the world
ive given too much of myself

oh shakira shakira hey 
he said im worth it his one desire
i know things about him that you wouldn wanna read about
he kissed me his one and only
this beautiful liar
tell me how you tolerate the things you just found out about
youll never know
why are we the ones who suffer
have to let go
he wont be the one to cry
ay lets not kill the karma
ay lets not start a fight
ay its not worth the drama
for a beautiful liar
oh can we laugh about it ha ha ha
oh its not worth our time
oh we can live without him
just a beautiful liar
i trusted him
but when i followed you
i saw you together
i didnt know about you then till i saw you with him again
i walked in on your love scene
slow dancing
you stole everything how can you say i did you wrong
we never know
when the pain and heartbreaks over
have to let go
the innocence is gone
ay lets not kill the karma
ay lets not start a fight
ay its not worth the drama
for a beautiful liar
oh can we laugh about it ha ha ha
oh its not worth our time
oh we can live without him
just a beautiful liar
tell me how to forgive you
when its me who ashamed
and i wish i could free you
of the hurt and the pain
but the answer is simple
he the one to blame hey 
ay beyonce beyonce
ay shakira shakira
oh beyonce beyonce

ici les gosses rvent tpirs beaucoup partent et peu qui restent 
nombreux sont ceux qui ds ans connaissent leur premire ivresse 
bienvenue lair pollu par les pots dchappement dclenchent
allergies en cascade et taux record do dans les bronches 
douleurs dans les hanches rien plus ddangereux qula faune humaine
quand ils explosent un fourgon brinks sans peine au tri nitro tolune 
les vices connus gnent la machine de letat les cabinets changent
laissent la merde en tat peu passent les menottes en mtal on en est l
ici blinds font cqui veulent font comme sils vivent seuls
ramnent tout leur tite gueule quand mille meurent fauchs dans lviseur
bienvenue aprs le septembre on voque une autvoie
au silence dis au revoir lenculeur dautfois dit baiser le monde haute voix
o les vieux des pays riches fantasment sur les mes de bangkok
pourquoi donc mettre part ces connards en taule
ici on croit moins en dieu quaux fant mes un hymne sanguinaire
on entonne partout on sent la peur dun peuple pass au pantone
lhiver mange et lprintemps parfois tue lautomne 
crie plus fort les grands de monde ont gar quelque part leur sonotone

o on se sait si fragile quon prvoit les pices drechange
dici peu de temps on sachtera des jambes en famille le dimanche
o tout le monde ne mange pas sa faim lieu de conflit sans fin
crer dans le fond pour quun seul parvienne ses fins
la misre comme moyen le suppos mort esclavage svit encore en divers lieux
tu vois il a toujours des grains de poussire vaniteux qui sprennent pour des dieux
bienvenue pas gattaca mais presque seul llu vite la presse
on parque le reste en attendant que vieillesse se manifeste 
o on parle prslection damlioration transformation
gntique cest pas magnifique une armada de super soldats de plomb

"took me a while but im finally here
so i just wanna testify make it crystal clear
see ive been picked out to be picked on
talked about out my friends mouths
ive been beat down til he turned my life around
seems like i always fall short of being worthy
cause i aint good enough but he still loves me
i aint no superstar the spotlight aint shining on me
cause i aint good enough but he still loves me
i used to wake up somedays
and wish id stayed asleep
cause i went to bed on top of the world
today the world on top of me
now everybody got opinions
they aint been in my position
that it breaks my heart
when i hear what they have to say about me
seems like i always fall short of being worthy
cause i aint good enough but he still loves me
i aint no superstar the spotlight aint shining on me
cause i aint good enough but he still loves me
and im not perfect
yes i do wrong
 im trying my best
but it aint good enough
shunned by the world
if i dont succeed
cause i aint good enough
but he still loves me
if you aint worthy just raise your hands
and let me know that you understand
that we are all so blessed to be loved loved
stand for him or fall for anything
cause through his eyes we all look the same
what will we do without pain 
seems like i always fall short of being worthy
cause i aint good enough but he still loves me
i aint no superstar the spotlight aint shining on me
cause i aint good enough but he still love me
 im not perfect
yes i do wrong
 im trying my best
but it aint good enough

the joy of life he needs it anyhow the joy of life the joy of taste
he makes the sound of a tender bear the joy of pepsi
as the crowd around him starts to swell

we teach girls to shrink themselves
to make themselves smaller
we say to girls
you can have ambition
but not too much
you should aim to be successful
but not too successful
otherwise you will threaten the man
because i am female
i am expected to aspire to marriage
i am expected to make my life choices
always keeping in mind that
marriage is the most important
now marriage can be a source of
joy and love and mutual support
but why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage
and we dont teach boys the same 
we raise girls to each other as competitors
not for jobs or for accomplishments
which i think can be a good thing
but for the attention of men
we teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings
in the way that boys are
feminist the person who believes in the social
political and economic equality of the sexes

"the cards never lie my last breath a sigh
and now i think about if its my time to die
i dont know what i was thinking steady wasting time with hill
and i need to live my life because my time is unforgivable
i can understand how my life changed around
manifest my destiny is it the brown on the grown 
blue skies are turning gray its the point of indecision
leaving in the car and much be spent on television
oh girlfriend get your mind on right
dont spend your time cause you can waste your time
everyday like its your last but you must feed the mind
intervention comes and snatch up all your dreams from behind
love you feel it and you got to let them know it
love your heart and thats the feeling that you go with
if you have a dream you need to go and let them know it
cause you could wake up in the morning and it could be over
no no no no
i dont wanna i dont wanna i dont wanna go
just just just let me stay home
let me live my dream let me see another dawn
no no no no
i dont wanna i dont wanna i dont wanna go
just just just let me stay home
let me live my dream let me see another dawn
carmen dont listen cause the cards have deceit
just slide him the money we dont need a receipt
truth only exists within the eyes of the beholder
plus he kind of young for fortune telling
he probably should be older
but the cards never lie i thought i told you
now its her turn to try to reach her goals
before she reaches the light
this is love
its like im trying to throw my life away
sometimes love is all you got
and other times it makes you pay
well when you finally rise
then youll realize
the windows to the soul are not the hips but the eyes
oh you could wish on the stars but they dead just a lie
but they shine just as bright as they did their entire life
no no no no
i dont wanna i dont wanna i dont wanna go
just just just let me stay home
let me live my dream let me see another dawn
no no no no
i dont wanna i dont wanna i dont wanna go
just just just let me stay home
let me live my dream let me see another dawn"

"i wanted to give all of my fans something extra
because this album was so special to me
and it came so effortlessly after i finished
the film of my life dreamgirls
because i was so inspired by deena
i wrote songs that were saying all the things
i wish she woulda said in the film
and i wanted to give you an extra special song
that deena sings its a pivotal moment
when deena finally does get the strength to stand up for herself
and does know who she is and knows what she wants
 im sure all of you women can relate to the lyrics
this is listen"

"all the ladies if you feel me help me sing it out
i can believe i believed
everything we had would last
so young and naive for me to think
she was from your past
silly of me to dream of
one day having your kids
love is so blind
it feels right when its wrong
i can believe i fell for four years
 im smarter than that
so dumb and naive to believe that with me
youre a changed man
foolish of me to compete
when you cheat with loose women
it took me some time but now ive moved on
cause i realized i got
me myself and i
thats all i got in the end
thats what i found out
and it aint no need to cry
i took a vow that from now on
 im a be my own best friend
me myself and i
thats all i got in the end
thats what i found out
and it aint no need to cry
i took a vow that from now
 im a be my own best friend
your so controlling you say that you love me
but you don t
your family told me one day
i would see it on my own
next thing i know im dealing
with your three kids in my home
love is so blind it feels right when its wrong
now that its over
stop calling me
come pick up yo clothes
no need to front like ya still wit me
all your homies know
even your very best friend
tried to warn me on the low
it took me some time
but now i am strong
cause i realized i got
me myself and i
thats all i got in the end
thats what i found out
and it aint no need to cry
i took a vow that from now on
 im a be my own best friend
i got me myself and i
must have cried a thousand times
i can regret time spent with you
but i lucked out to make it through"
"i wish i could believe you
then ill be alright
but now evrything you told me
really dont apply
to the way i feel inside
lovin you was easy once upon a time
but now my suspicions of you have multiplied
and its all because you lied
i only give you a hard time
cause i can go on and pretend like
i haven tried to forget this
but im much too full of resentment
just can seem to get over the way you hurt me
dont know how you gave another
who didnt mean a thing no
the very thing you gave to me
i thought i could forgive you
and i know youve changed
as much as i wanna trust you
i know it aint the same
and its all because you lied
i only give you a hard time
cause i can go on and pretend like
i haven tried to forget this
but im much too full of resentment
i may never understand why
 im doing the best that i can and i
i tried and i tried to forgive this
but im much too full of resentment
ill always remember feelin
like i was no good
like i couldn do it for you
like your mistress could
and its all because you lied
loved you more than ever
more than my own life
the best part of me i gave you
it was sacrificed
and its all because you lied
i only give you a hard time
cause i can go on and pretend like
i tried and i tried to forgive this
but im damn too full of resentment
i know she was attractive
but i was here first
been ridin with you for six years
why did i deserve
to be treated this way by you you 
i know youre probly thinkin
whats up with 
ive been cryin for too long
what did you do to me 
i used to be so strong
but now you took my soul
 im cryin can stop cryin

and see she had half of me

"satellites flashing by
its a beautiful state were in
but how can we love in isolation 
think how happy we can be when we just try
when nothing like we seem
passionate words are never spoken
you dont know how i bleed
when i leave your side
in your eyes love alive
youve come untied
cause were flashing by
like satellites satellites
take all the rules away
how can we live if we dont change 
were always on display
lets run and hide
in our eyes love alive
weve come untied
cause were flashing by
like satellites satellites
if we dont communicate
well exist in our own space
we have all the love we need
while were apart i cannot breathe
satellites flashing by
satellites"

"mama i understand your many sleepless nights
when you sit and you think about father
or how you tried to be the perfect wife
you used to dress and fix your hair
then you smiled through your tears
in the mirror you would stare
and say a prayer
like i wish he said im beautiful
i wish it didnt hurt at all
i dont know how i got here
i was once the one who had his heart
until you had enough then you took that ring off
you took that ring off
so tired of the lies and trying fighting crying
took that ring off
oh now the fun begins
dust yourself off and you love again
you found a new man now you shine and youre fine
like its my time you took that ring off
mama so sexy you live and learn thats just the way life goes
uh you a killer you a killer killer
always know that youve got a daughter
thats so so proud you took the high road
you a killer so sexy
you used to dress and fix your hair
then you smiled through your tears
in the mirror you would stare
and say a prayer
like i wish he said im beautiful
i wish it didnt hurt at all
i dont know how i got here
i was once the one who had his heart
until you had enough then you took that ring off
you took that ring off
so tired of the lies and trying fighting crying
took that ring off
oh now the fun begins
dust yourself off and you love again
you found a new man now you shine and youre fine
like its my time you took that ring off
after all your tears
after all that pain all clear
mama after all them years
we can start all over again
mama and now it all makes sense
letting go is never the end
mama we can love again
this is where freedom begins
mama so put your love on top
you gon shine and put your love on top
its your time to put your love on top
everybody put your love on top
aye love on top

its your time to put your love on top
girl you so fine put your love on top
if youre going through it just know its called going through it
